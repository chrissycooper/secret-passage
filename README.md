### Learning Goals
This was the showcase project for Module Three of the Front End Engineering program at Turing School of Software and Design. The goal was to demonstrate skills in React, Router, Asynchronous Javascript, and end to end testing with Cypress. 

### Wins
There was a very short timeline for this project, about five days for planning and execution. I am really proud of what I was able to accomplish within this timeline.
I am very pleased with the passkey's random position, it turned out to be a very fun application to play with, and the combination of poems and styling can make for some enjoyable juxtaposition. 

### Challenges
I structured my application with a set of nested components, and I struggled with handling bad url errors. The Poems component contains an array of Poem components, each which is wrapped in a Route. I wasn't able to get the Reroute to include bad urls like this: `/poems/banana`. There are only three valid `/poems/` routes. 

### Shout Outs
I utilized this [list of most commonly used poetry words](https://www.robertpeake.com/archives/6676-top-poetry-words.html) from Robert Peake to create my styling schema.

Thanks to @thundercomb who created [this API](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb) which made this project possible.
